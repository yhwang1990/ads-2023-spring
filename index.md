## Algorithm Foundations of Data Science and Engineering
## ------   2021, Fall   ------

### Course Description
Data scientists, that peculiar mix of software engineer and statistician. The purpose of this course is to introduce some commonly used algorithms for data scientists and engineers. In particular, this class is meant to introduce randomized , statistical, algebraic, and optimized algorithms, with an emphasis on applications in the real life.

### Project
- **Project 1: Image Compression**
  1. **Task Description:** Principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimensions of the matrix (image) and project those new dimensions to reform the image that retains its qualities but is smaller in k-weight. You can choose 100 images from single class from the following dataset, and employ PCA to compress the images. In the final report, please illustrate the performance of image compression, such as reconstruction error, space saving, compressing rate, and case study, etc.

- **Project 2: Text Summarization**
  1. **Task Description:** Please crawl a corpus from the Web, which contains some documents under a topic, extract keywords from them. Implement an algorithm to generate 100 summarizations from the corpus. In the final report, please illustrate the performance of text summarization, such as elapsed time, quality of generated summaries, and case study, etc.
