# Algorithms for Data Science and Engineering

## ---  2023, Spring  ---

### Course Description

Data scientists, that peculiar mix of software engineer and statistician. The purpose of this course is to introduce some commonly used algorithms for data scientists and engineers. In particular, this class is meant to introduce randomized , statistical, algebraic, and optimized algorithms, with an emphasis on applications in the real life.

### Project

- **Project 1: Similarity Search**
  1. **Task Description:** Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular. You can choose 100 images from single class from the following dataset, and employ PCA to compress the images. In the final report, please illustrate the performance of image compression, such as reconstruction error, space saving, compressing rate, and case study, etc.
  2. **Dataset** [[Download](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pO-l7Nnnanqj13LktSyeVQ)] (Code: 33x9)
  3. **Report Template** [[Template](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uJyUGNLTauhxd-Pnyqc9gA)] (Code: h79m)
- **Project 2: Image Compression**
  1. **Task Description:** Principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimensions of the matrix (image) and project those new dimensions to reform the image that retains its qualities but is smaller in k-weight. You can choose 100 images from single class from the following dataset, and employ PCA to compress the images. In the final report, please illustrate the performance of image compression, such as reconstruction error, space saving, compressing rate, and case study, etc.

- **Project 3: Text Summarization**
  1. **Task Description:** You should crawl a corpus from the Web, which contains some documents under a topic, and extract keywords from them. Then, you need to implement an algorithm (based on the maximum k-coverage problem) to generate 100 summaries from the corpus. In the final report, please illustrate the performance of text summarization, such as elapsed time, quality of generated summaries, and case study, etc.
